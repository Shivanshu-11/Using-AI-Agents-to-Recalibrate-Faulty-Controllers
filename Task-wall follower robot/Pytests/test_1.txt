1. No obstacles
Input: [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]

Why: All sensor values are low; robot is far from any obstacle.

Expected behavior:

left_obstacle: False
(No left-side sensor above threshold)

right_obstacle: False
(No right-side sensor above threshold)

Wheel speeds: Both set to half of max speed (0.5 * MAX_SPEED) so the robot moves straight ahead.
