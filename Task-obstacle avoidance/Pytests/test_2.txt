2. Left obstacle
Input: [0][0][0][0][0][90][90][90]

Why: Only the left-side sensors (positions 5, 6, 7) detect high values (meaning an obstacle is close at the left).

Expected behavior:

left_obstacle: True
(At least one left sensor above threshold)

right_obstacle: False

Wheel speeds: Robot turns right (left wheel forward, right wheel backward): leftSpeed = +0.5 * MAX_SPEED, rightSpeed = -0.5 * MAX_SPEED.
