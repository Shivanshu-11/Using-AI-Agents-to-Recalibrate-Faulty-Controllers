4. Both sides obstacles
Input: [90][0][0][0][0][90][0][90]

Why: Both a right-side and one or more left-side sensors detect high values.

Expected behavior:

left_obstacle: True
(Left side takes priority if both detected)

right_obstacle: True

Wheel speeds: Per your code logic, robot prioritizes turning right as when only left_obstacle is detected (leftSpeed = +0.5 * MAX_SPEED, rightSpeed = -0.5 * MAX_SPEED).
