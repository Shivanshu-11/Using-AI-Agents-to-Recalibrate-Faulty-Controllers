5. All sensors at threshold
Input: [80.0, 80.0, 80.0, 80.0, 80.0, 80.0, 80.0, 80.0]

Why: All sensor readings are exactly on the threshold boundary. Since your code uses > 80.0 for obstacle detection, no sensor triggers as 'obstacle'.

Expected behavior:

left_obstacle: False

right_obstacle: False

Wheel speeds: Robot moves straight ahead at half speed.
